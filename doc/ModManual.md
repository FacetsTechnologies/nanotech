# Nanotech Manual



## Lore

The Gregeel attempted to invade the minecraft world, but were repelled by an ancient unidentified race. Some say it was the denizens of the Deep Dark that defeated the alien incursion, but very few artifacts of the time have been found and what "evidence" has been brought forward has been inconclusive at best.

The wreckage of some Gregeel ships can still be found throughout the world.
